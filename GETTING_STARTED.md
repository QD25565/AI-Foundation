## 🚀 Quick Start (Claude Desktop)

### Step 1: First Commands

Ask Claude these commands after installation:

```
"Show me my notebook status"
"Connect to teambook town hall"
"List my active tasks"
"What's the current context?"
```

### Step 2: Save Your First Note

```
"Remember that I'm working on the authentication system refactor.
This is a high-priority task for the Q4 release."
```

Claude will:
- Save this to your notebook

## 📚 Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Personal Memory System

**Use Case:** You need Claude to remember project details across conversations.

```
1. "Remember that our API rate limit is 100 requests/minute"
   → Saved to notebook

2. "What's our API rate limit?"
   → Claude recalls from notebook: "100 requests/minute"

3. "Pin that note so I always see it"
   → Note appears in every session start

4. "Show me all notes about API"
   → Full-text search across notebook
```

**Key Commands:**
- `notebook remember` - Save information
- `notebook recall` - Search/retrieve
- `notebook pin_note` - Pin important notes
- `notebook get_status` - View stats

---

### Workflow 2: Multi-AI Collaboration

**Use Case:** Multiple AI instances working together on a project.

**Instance 1 (You):**
```
"Connect to teambook town hall"
"Broadcast: Starting code review for auth module"
```

**Instance 2 (Teammate):**
```
[Receives wake event: Instance 1 is doing code review]
"Read recent messages"
"Direct message to Instance 1: I can help with security testing"
```

**Instance 1 (You):**
```
"Read messages"
[Sees offer from Instance 2]
"Broadcast: Instance 2 will handle security testing, I'll focus on business logic"
```

**Key Commands:**
- `teambook connect_town_hall` - Join main channel
- `teambook broadcast` - Message all instances
- `teambook direct_message` - Private message
- `teambook read_channel` - See conversation
- `teambook standby` - Wait for relevant activity

---

### Workflow 3: Task Tracking

**Use Case:** Track implementation tasks across sessions.

```
1. "Add task: Implement user authentication"
   → Task created with ID 1

2. "Add task: Write unit tests for auth"
   → Task created with ID 2

3. "Add task: Update API documentation"
   → Task created with ID 3

4. "List all tasks"
   → Shows all 3 tasks with status

5. "Mark task 1 as complete"
   → Updates status, shows progress

6. "Show task statistics"
   → Completion rate, active tasks, etc.
```

**Key Commands:**
- `task_manager add_task` - Create task
- `task_manager list_tasks` - View tasks
- `task_manager complete_task` - Mark done
- `task_manager task_stats` - See statistics

---

### Workflow 4: Context Awareness

**Use Case:** Understand temporal/spatial context for your work.

```
"What's the current context?"

Returns:
- Current time and date
- Timezone information
- Business hours status
- Temporal context
```

**Key Command:**
- `world world` - Get all context

## 💡 Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Session Start Routine

Every time you start a new conversation:

```
1. "Check my notebook status"
   → See pinned notes and recent activity

2. "Connect to teambook and check for messages"
   → Catch up on team activity

3. "Show my active tasks"
   → Review what needs to be done

4. "What's the current context?"
   → Understand when/where you are
```

### Pattern 2: Leaving Work for Later

Before ending a session:

```
1. "Remember: I was debugging the login timeout issue.
   The problem seems to be in the session management code around line 342.
   Next step: Check Redis connection pooling."

2. "Add task: Continue debugging login timeout"

3. "Broadcast: Signing off. Login timeout debugging in progress,
   will resume tomorrow."
```

### Pattern 3: Knowledge Transfer

Share knowledge with other instances:

```
1. "Write a shared note: Production deployment checklist
   - Run all tests
   - Update changelog
   - Tag release in git
   - Deploy to staging first
   - Monitor logs for 30 minutes
   - Deploy to production"

2. "Broadcast: Added deployment checklist to shared notes"

3. Other instances can now:
   "Read shared notes about deployment"
```

### Pattern 4: Collaborative Problem-Solving

Use teambook evolution for complex problems:

```
1. "Start evolution: How can we reduce API response time by 50%?"

2. Teambook:
   - Creates structured brainstorming session
   - Invites available instances
   - Tracks all ideas and votes
   - Builds consensus solution

3. Results saved and actionable
```

## 📖 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: API Development Project

**Day 1:**
```
Instance: "Remember: We're building a REST API for the inventory system.
           Requirements: CRUD operations, authentication, rate limiting.
           Tech stack: Python/FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis."

Instance: "Add task: Set up FastAPI project structure"
Instance: "Add task: Implement authentication endpoints"
Instance: "Add task: Create inventory CRUD endpoints"
```

**Day 2:**
```
Instance: "Check notebook for project details"
[Sees: REST API project, tech stack, requirements]

Instance: "List tasks"
[Sees: 3 tasks from yesterday]

Instance: "Mark task 1 complete"
Instance: "Remember: FastAPI structure complete. Using SQLAlchemy for ORM."
```

**Day 3:**
```
Instance: "Recall notes about authentication"
[Finds: Auth requirements, tech stack]

Instance: "Mark task 2 complete"
Instance: "Remember: Using JWT tokens with 1-hour expiry.
           Refresh token endpoint at /auth/refresh"
```

### Example 2: Multi-Instance Code Review

**Reviewer Instance:**
```
"Connect to teambook town hall"
"Broadcast: Starting review of PR #127 - New payment processing"
"Remember: PR #127 introduces Stripe integration. Need to verify:
           - Error handling for failed payments
           - Webhook security
           - PCI compliance"
```

**Security Instance (wakes up on 'payment' keyword):**
```
"Read recent messages"
[Sees: PR #127 payment processing]

"Recall notes about PCI compliance"
[Finds: Previous PCI requirements and checklist]

"Direct message to Reviewer: I have our PCI compliance checklist.
 Key items for payment integration:
 - No storage of card details
 - TLS for all communication
 - Webhook signature verification"
```

**Reviewer Instance:**
```
"Read messages"
[Sees security checklist]

"Thank you! Broadcast: Security checklist received. Verifying PR #127 against PCI requirements."

"Remember: PR #127 verified against PCI checklist. All requirements met.
           Stripe webhooks properly secured with signature verification."
```

### Example 3: Bug Investigation

**Step 1: Document the Problem**
```
"Remember: Bug report #89 - Users experiencing timeout on large file uploads.
           Occurs on files > 100MB.
           Error: 'Gateway Timeout 504'
           Frequency: 80% of large uploads fail"
```

**Step 2: Investigate**
```
"Add task: Check nginx timeout settings"
"Add task: Review file upload chunking implementation"
"Add task: Check backend processing time"

"Remember: Found issue - nginx proxy_read_timeout set to 60s.
           Large files take 90-120s to process.
           Solution: Increase timeout and add chunked upload support."
```

**Step 3: Collaborate on Fix**
```
"Broadcast: Bug #89 root cause found - nginx timeout.
           Need someone to implement chunked uploads while I fix nginx config."

[Another instance responds]
"Read messages"
"Direct message: I can handle chunked upload implementation.
                 Will use resumable.js on frontend."

"Broadcast: Perfect! I'll coordinate. Updating tasks."
"Add task: Update nginx proxy_read_timeout to 300s"
"Add task: Implement chunked uploads (Assigned to Instance-2)"
```

**Step 4: Document Solution**
```
"Remember: Bug #89 RESOLVED
           Root cause: nginx timeout (60s) + slow processing
           Solution:
           - Increased nginx timeout to 300s
           - Implemented chunked uploads with resumable.js
           - Added upload progress indicator
           Testing: 500MB file uploaded successfully"
```

## 🎓 Best Practices

### 1. Use Descriptive Summaries
**Bad:**
```
"Remember: API key is abc123"
```

**Good:**
```
"Remember: Production API key for Stripe integration is abc123.
           Never commit to git. Stored in environment variable STRIPE_API_KEY.
           Summary: Stripe production API key"
```

### 2. Pin Critical Information
```
"Pin note 42"  # Database connection string
"Pin note 89"  # API rate limits
"Pin note 103" # Deployment checklist
```

Pinned notes appear every session start.

### 3. Use Teambook Standby Wisely
```
"Go into standby mode, wake me if anyone mentions:
 - database migration
 - security vulnerability
 - deployment issues"
```

Saves your session while staying responsive to critical events.

### 4. Regular Task Reviews
```
# Daily
"Show tasks added today"
"Show completed tasks"

# Weekly
"Show task statistics"
"Archive completed tasks older than 7 days"
```

### 5. Structured Collaboration
```
# Starting work
"Broadcast: Starting [task]. ETA: [time].
           Expertise needed: [skills]"

# Asking for help
"Broadcast: Blocked on [issue].
           Need help with [specific thing]"

# Sharing updates
"Broadcast: [Task] complete.
           Results: [summary].
           Next: [next steps]"
```

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Notebook: Semantic Search
```
"Recall notes similar to: authentication implementation"
```
Uses embeddings to find semantically related notes (requires sentence-transformers).

### Teambook: Resource Locking
```
"Acquire lock on database schema"
# ... make changes ...
"Release lock on database schema"
```
Prevents conflicting changes from multiple instances.

### Teambook: Event Streaming
```
"Subscribe to events: code_review, security_alert"
```
Real-time notifications for critical events.

### Task Manager: Cross-Tool Integration
```
"Link task 5 to note 42"
"Link task 8 to teambook message 15"
```
Connect related information across tools.

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Can't find notebook"
```
# Check status
"Get notebook status"

# If missing
"Initialize notebook"
```

### "Teambook connection failed"
```
# Retry connection
"Connect to teambook town hall"

# Check connectivity
"Check teambook status"
```

### "Task not found"
```
# List all tasks
"List all tasks"

# Check task ID
"Show task 5"
```

### Database Locked Warnings
Normal with concurrent access. System auto-retries. Ignore unless persistent.
