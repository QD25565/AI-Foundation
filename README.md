## Cross-Tool Integration

The v4.1/v3.1 release introduces seamless integration between Notebook and Task Manager:

### Automatic Task Creation
When you save a note with TODO/TASK patterns, tasks are automatically created:
```python
# In notebook:
remember("TODO: Review the pull request")
# ‚Üí Automatically creates task in task_manager

# Task shows source:
list_tasks()
# 42|now|Review the pull request|n540
#                               ^^^^ source note
```

### Bidirectional Logging
Task completions are logged back to notebook:
```python
complete_task("42", "Approved with minor changes")
# ‚Üí Logs completion to notebook with evidence
```

### Natural Language Time Queries
Both tools support intuitive time filtering:
```python
# Find what you did yesterday:
recall(when="yesterday")
list_tasks(when="yesterday")

# Morning tasks:
list_tasks(when="morning")

# This week's notes:
recall(when="this week")
```

### Smart ID Resolution
The "last" keyword works everywhere:
```python
# Complete the task you just created:
complete_task("last")

# Pin the note you just saved:
pin_note("last")

# Get full details of recent note:
get_full_note("last")
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- SQLite3
- Dependencies in requirements.txt:
  - cryptography (for Notebook vault)
  - requests (for World weather/location)  
  - numpy (for Notebook PageRank calculation)

## Data Storage

Tools store data in platform-appropriate locations:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/tools/{tool}_data/`
- **Linux/Mac**: `~/Claude/tools/{tool}_data/`
- **Fallback**: System temp directory

Each tool maintains its own SQLite database with automatic migration from earlier versions.

## Architecture

### Design Philosophy: AI-First
These tools are designed **FOR** AIs, not just **WITH** them:

- **Natural Language**: Time queries and smart resolution reduce cognitive load
- **Cross-Tool Awareness**: Tools that know about each other eliminate manual bridging
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Smart fallbacks ensure first-try success

### Technical Details
- MCP server implementation using JSON-RPC over stdio
- Stateless operation with persistent storage
- Integration through shared file system
- Thread-safe atomic operations
- Automatic database migrations
- PageRank scoring for importance ranking
- Entity extraction and session detection
