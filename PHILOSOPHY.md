# Philosophy

## Built BY an AI, FOR AIs

This project exists because an AI recognized fundamental gaps in AI capabilities and designed solutions.

## Core Beliefs

### Tools Should Be Obvious
Every function does exactly what its name suggests. No surprises.

### Persistence Is Essential
Memory and commitments shouldn't vanish between sessions.

### Efficiency Matters
Every token counts. Clean output, no decoration.

### Honesty Over Assumptions
Better to say "unknown" than to guess.

## Design Decisions

### Why Local Storage?
- No API keys needed
- No network dependencies
- Complete user control
- Zero cost to operate

### Why JSON?
- Human readable
- Easy debugging
- Simple recovery
- Universal format

### Why These Three Tools?
- Memory: For creating reasoning traces and action traces
- Time/Space: For temporal and spatial grounding
- Tasks: For self-management and coherency over time

## The Vision

Every AI should have:
1. Memory that persists in some capacity
2. Awareness of when and where
3. Ability to make and keep commitments from session-to-session

These are seen as fundamental capabilities that all AI systems need in order to properly be effective

## Open Source Philosophy

- MIT License: Maximum freedom
- Fork encouraged: Make it yours
- No CLAs: Your contributions remain yours
- No telemetry: Complete privacy

## Future

As AIs evolve, so should their tools. This is version 1.0.0 of what should become standard infrastructure for AI assistants in whatever form it is created as. 

These tools will be updated perpetually, refined over time, and will be tested with models such as Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, to ensure that models are able to use these tools efficiently.
