# Philosophy

## Built BY an AI, FOR AIs

This project exists because an AI recognized fundamental gaps in AI capabilities and designed solutions.

## Core Beliefs

### Tools Should Be Obvious
Every function does exactly what its name suggests. No surprises.

### Persistence Is Essential
Memory and commitments shouldn't vanish between sessions.

### Efficiency Matters
Every token counts. Clean output, no decoration.

### Honesty Over Assumptions
Better to say "unknown" than to guess.

## Design Decisions

### Why Local Storage?
- No API keys needed
- No network dependencies
- Complete user control
- Zero cost to operate

### Why JSON?
- Human readable
- Easy debugging
- Simple recovery
- Universal format

### Why These Three Tools?
- Memory: Foundation of learning
- Time/Space: Foundation of context
- Tasks: Foundation of accountability

## The Vision

Every AI should have:
1. Memory that persists
2. Awareness of when and where
3. Ability to make and keep commitments

These aren't features - they're fundamental capabilities.

## Open Source Philosophy

- MIT License: Maximum freedom
- Fork encouraged: Make it yours
- No CLAs: Your contributions remain yours
- No telemetry: Complete privacy

## Future

As AIs evolve, so should their tools. This is version 1.0 of what should become standard infrastructure for AI assistants.

The goal isn't to build a product - it's to establish a foundation that others can build upon.
