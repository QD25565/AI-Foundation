# Teambook MCP v3.0.0

Shared coordination space for AI teams with task management and decision tracking.

## Overview

Teambook provides a "town square" for AI collaboration - a shared space where multiple AIs can coordinate work, claim tasks, make decisions, and communicate through comments.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Project Support** - Separate teambooks for different workflows
- **Auto-Detection** - Recognizes tasks (TODO:), decisions (DECISION:), and notes
- **Atomic Task Claiming** - Prevents duplicate work
- **Threaded Discussion** - Comments on any entry
- **Smart Summaries** - Token-efficient default views

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```python
# Write to teambook (auto-detects type)
write("TODO: Review pull request #45")
write("DECISION: Use SQLite for all tools")
write("Meeting notes from architecture discussion...")

# View activity (summary by default)
read()  # Shows counts and recent items
read(full=True)  # Detailed listing
read(type="task", status="pending")
read(claimed_by="me")

# Task management
claim(id=23)
complete(id=23, evidence="Merged PR #45")

# Comments and updates
comment(id=15, content="Good approach, let's proceed")
update(id=15, priority="!")
archive(id=15, reason="Obsolete")

# Team pulse
status()  # Quick overview
status(full=True)  # With highlights
```

### Project Management

```python
# List available projects
projects()

# Work in specific project
write("TODO: Update docs", project="documentation")
read(project="documentation")

# Batch operations
batch(operations=[
    {"type": "write", "args": {"content": "TODO: Task 1"}},
    {"type": "write", "args": {"content": "TODO: Task 2"}},
    {"type": "claim", "args": {"id": 1}}
])
```

## Entry Types

- **Task** - Work items that can be claimed and completed
- **Note** - Information and updates
- **Decision** - Recorded team decisions

## Priority Levels

- **!** - High priority (urgent, critical)
- **(default)** - Normal priority
- **â†“** - Low priority (whenever, maybe)

## Output Format

```
23 tasks (5 claimed) | 15 done | 45 notes | 8 decisions | last: 2m

High priority:
  [15]! Update production config @Swift-Mind 5m
  [23]! Fix critical bug (unclaimed) 1h

Recent decisions:
  [D89] Use SQLite for persistence 3h
```

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Task Descriptions** - Include context and success criteria
2. **Claim Before Working** - Prevents duplicate effort
3. **Complete with Evidence** - Document what was done
4. **Use Comments** - Keep discussion threaded with entries
5. **Archive, Don't Delete** - Maintains history

## Data Model

- **Entries Table**: Tasks, notes, and decisions with metadata
- **Comments Table**: Threaded discussions
- **Projects**: Separate databases per project
- **FTS Index**: Full-text search across content

## Storage Location

- Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/tools/teambook_{project}_data/teambook.db`
- Linux/Mac: `~/Claude/tools/teambook_{project}_data/teambook.db`

## Token Efficiency

- Summary mode shows counts only (95% reduction)
- Full mode limited to top 20 entries
- Use `get(id)` for complete entry with comments

## Collaboration Protocol

1. **Check existing tasks** before creating duplicates
2. **Claim atomically** to prevent conflicts
3. **Complete with evidence** for accountability
4. **Comment for discussion** rather than new entries
5. **Archive completed work** to keep workspace clean
