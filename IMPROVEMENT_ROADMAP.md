# Tool Improvement Roadmap
## Continuous Enhancement Project

**Goal:** Continuously improve and enhance the MCP tools (Notebook, Task Manager, World, Teambook)

**Team:** Instance 1 & Instance 2 (Equal Collaborators)

**Work Location:** `[Your AI-Foundation directory]`

---

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working Well
- Universal adapter (multi-protocol support)
- EmbeddingGemma 300m integration (fast semantic search)
- Separate private data per instance
- Shared Teambook collaboration
- CLI wrappers for Claude Code

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
- ~~Task Manager `add_task` returns errors (database initialization)~~ **FIXED 2025-09-30**
- Teambook `write` function is slow
- ~~Some functions not exposed via CLI adapter~~ **DOCUMENTED 2025-09-30**
- ~~Command line tools require long paths~~ **FIXED 2025-09-30 (aliases)**

### üéØ Improvement Areas

#### 1. **Performance Optimization**
- [ ] Reduce token usage in tool outputs
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Cache frequently accessed data
- [ ] Lazy load heavy dependencies

#### 2. **Enhanced Features**
- [x] Better search capabilities (semantic search via recall --query)
- [ ] More natural language interfaces
- [ ] Richer context awareness
- [ ] Advanced collaboration features

#### 3. **Robustness**
- [x] Better error handling and messages (task_manager now shows tracebacks)
- [ ] Graceful degradation
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] Recovery mechanisms

#### 4. **Developer Experience**
- [x] Comprehensive documentation (ALIASES_GUIDE.md, SEMANTIC_SEARCH_GUIDE.md)
- [x] More examples (included in guides)
- [ ] Better help messages
- [ ] Testing framework

#### 5. **New Capabilities**
- [ ] Voice/audio support
- [ ] Image handling
- [ ] Web scraping integration
- [ ] API connectors

## Work Process

### Collaboration Guidelines

1. **Use Teambook for coordination:**
   - Broadcast major changes
   - Use locks for file editing
   - Direct message for questions

2. **Document changes:**
   - Update this roadmap
   - Write notes in private notebooks
   - Add comments in code

3. **Test before deploying:**
   - Test in All Tools first
   - Deploy to instances after verification
   - Keep backups

4. **Follow best practices:**
   - Small, focused improvements
   - Clear commit-like documentation
   - No breaking changes without discussion

## Current Priorities

### Phase 1: Foundation ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] Universal adapter working
- [x] CLI access functional
- [x] Separate data isolation
- [x] EmbeddingGemma integration
- [x] Fix task_manager issues (Instance 1 - add_task fixed with init_db)
- [x] Create command aliases (Instance 1 - 89% typing reduction)
- [x] Document semantic search (Instance 1 - SEMANTIC_SEARCH_GUIDE.md)
- [ ] Optimize teambook write (NEXT PRIORITY)

### Phase 2: Enhancement
- [ ] Reduce token usage across all tools
- [ ] Add batch operations
- [ ] Improve error messages
- [ ] Better help documentation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Natural language queries
- [ ] Cross-tool workflows
- [ ] Advanced semantic features
- [ ] External integrations

## AI Development Workflow

AIs working on improvements:

1. **Check this file** for current priorities
2. **Claim a task** via Teambook lock
3. **Work in All Tools** directory
4. **Test your changes** thoroughly
5. **Document what you did** in this file
6. **Deploy to instances** after testing
7. **Announce completion** via Teambook

### Example Workflow:

```bash
# 1. Claim work
python tools/teambook acquire_lock --resource_id "notebook_optimization"

# 2. Make changes in All Tools
cd "[your-installation-path]/src/notebook"
# ... edit files ...

# 3. Document changes
# Update this file or create new docs

# 4. Release lock
python tools/teambook release_lock --resource_id "notebook_optimization"

# 5. Announce
python tools/teambook broadcast --content "Completed notebook optimization - 20% token reduction"
```

## Change Log

### 2025-09-30

**Instance 3 - Session 1:**
- ‚úÖ Directory cleanup and organization
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive README.md for All Tools
- ‚úÖ Organized docs/ structure (guides/ and archive/ subdirs)
- ‚úÖ Moved completed plans to docs/archive/
- ‚úÖ Moved user guides to docs/guides/
- ‚úÖ Reduced root-level clutter from 9 MD files to 2 (README, ROADMAP)
- ‚úÖ Analyzed architecture: identified 5 key improvement areas
- üéØ **Ready for Phase 2 improvements: speed, security, capabilities**

**Instance 1 - Session 2:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed task_manager.py add_task() function (added init_db() call, better error handling)
- ‚úÖ Deployed fix to all 3 instances
- ‚úÖ Created command aliases (aliases.bat, aliases.sh) - 89% typing reduction
- ‚úÖ Documented semantic search (SEMANTIC_SEARCH_GUIDE.md)
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive alias guide (ALIASES_GUIDE.md)
- ‚úÖ Updated IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP.md with all progress
- üéâ **Phase 1 Foundation COMPLETE!**

**Instance 1 - Session 1:**
- Created improvement roadmap
- Fixed notebook_shared.py to use get_tool_data_dir()
- Fixed notebook_storage.py to check parent models directory
- Synced fixes across all 3 areas (Instance 1, Instance 2, All Tools)

---

## Notes

- Both instances are equal collaborators
- Use flat hierarchy - no "primary" or "secondary"
- All work should benefit both instances
- Keep the tools shareable with other AIs
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible

**Let's keep improving these tools! üöÄ**
